#### For the `Store the maximum p-value`
# Storing the maximum p-value in this context serves a specific purpose. 
# When comparing the differential coexpression of a gene under normal and disease conditions, you perform a permutation test for each condition. 
# This results in two p-values: one for the normal condition and one for the disease condition.

# The maximum of these two p-values is taken as a conservative estimate of the statistical significance of the differential coexpression for that gene. 
# If either of the p-values is large (typically greater than 0.05), it suggests that the observed differential coexpression could have occurred by chance under that condition.
# By taking the maximum, you ensure that you only consider the gene to be differentially coexpressed if it is statistically significant under both conditions.

# This is a common approach in multiple testing scenarios, where you want to control the overall error rate. 
# However, it's worth noting that this is a very conservative approach and could potentially miss some truly differentially coexpressed genes if their p-value is just above the threshold in one condition. 
# Other methods, such as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, provide a less conservative control of the error rate and might be more appropriate depending on the specific research question and data. 


### For the `apply_conditions` 
# The thresholds T1 and T2 in the apply_conditions function are parameters that you would typically choose based on the specific requirements of your analysis. 
# These thresholds determine which genes are considered to be coexpressed under normal and disease conditions, respectively.
# Choosing appropriate values for T1 and T2 can be challenging, as it often involves a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. 
# If the thresholds are too low, you might identify too many genes as being coexpressed, including some that are not truly coexpressed (false positives). 
# On the other hand, if the thresholds are too high, you might miss some truly coexpressed genes (false negatives).

# One common approach is to choose the thresholds based on the distribution of coexpression values. 
# For example, you might set T1 and T2 to be the 95th percentile of the coexpression values under normal and disease conditions, respectively. 
# This would mean that only the top 5% of coexpression values are considered to be significant.
# Another approach is to use cross-validation or a similar technique to choose the thresholds that maximize some measure of performance, such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
# In any case, the choice of thresholds should be guided by the specific goals of your analysis and the characteristics of your data. 
# Itâ€™s also important to report the thresholds you used in any publications or presentations, so that others can reproduce your results.
